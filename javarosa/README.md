JavaRosa is a Java library for rendering forms that are compliant with [ODK XForms spec](http://opendatakit.github.io/xforms-spec). It is at the heart of many of the ODK tools. ODK JavaRosa is a fork of [JavaRosa](https://bitbucket.org/javarosa/javarosa/wiki/Home) 1.0 that has been modified to NOT run on J2ME devices. The key differences are:

* Regularly updated to ensure spec compliance
* KoBo additional instance defn. and filter paths
* remember all bind attributes and any additional attributes on `<input>`, `<select>`, `<group>`, etc. statements
* numerous enhancements and contributions from SurveyCTO and others.
* J2ME sub-projects removed

ODK JavaRosa is part of Open Data Kit (ODK), a free and open-source set of tools which help organizations author, field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. Learn more about the Open Data Kit project and its history [here](https://opendatakit.org/about/) and read about example ODK deployments [here](https://opendatakit.org/about/deployments/).

## Setting up your development environment

1. Fork the javarosa project ([why and how to fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))

1. Clone your fork of the project locally. At the command line:

        git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/javarosa

We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for development. On the welcome screen, click `Import Project`, navigate to your javarosa folder, and select the `build.gradle` file. Use the defaults through the wizard. Once the project is imported, IntelliJ may ask you to update your remote Maven repositories. Follow the instructions to do so. 
 
## Building the project
 
To build the project, go to the `View` menu, then `Tool Windows > Gradle`. `build` will be in `odk-javarosa > Tasks > build > build`. Double-click `build` to package the application. This Gradle task will now be the default action in your `Run` menu. 

To package a jar, use the `jar` Gradle task.

## Contributing code

Any and all contributions to the project are welcome. ODK JavaRosa is used across the world primarily by organizations with a social purpose so you can have real impact!

If you're ready to contribute code, see [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Downloading builds

Per-commit debug builds can be found on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/opendatakit/javarosa). Login with your GitHub account, click the build you'd like, then find the JAR in the Artifacts tab under $CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS.

## Publishing the jar to OSSRH and Maven Central

Project maintainers have the private keys to upload signed jars to Sonatype's OSS Repository Hosting (OSSRH) service which is then synced to Maven's Central Repository. This process is [outlined here](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html).

While Gradle is the default build tool for all ODK tools (including this one), Maven is used for for publishing the jar because OSSRH's Gradle support is unreliable (e.g., snapshots don't always update). This means version and dependency changes must be made in both `build.gradle` and `pom.xml`.

Deviations from OSSRH's documentation are that maintainers use `gpg2` v2.1 and greater (not `gpg`), the latest versions of the Maven plugins in `pom.xml`, and a `secrets.xml` file that include the GPG home directory, key name, and pass phrase. All that is needed in the GPG home directory is `private-keys-v1.d` and `pubring.gpg`.
```
<!-- secrets.xml -->
<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>ossrh</id>
            <username>opendatakit</username>
            <password>very-secure-password</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>ossrh</id>
            <activation>
                <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
            </activation>
            <properties>
                <gpg.executable>/path/to/gpg2</gpg.executable>
                <gpg.homedir>/path/to/javarosa/gpg/folder</gpg.homedir>
                <gpg.keyname>1234ABCD</gpg.keyname>
                <gpg.passphrase>very-secure-passphrase</gpg.passphrase>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
</settings>
```

Official releases are typically done by @yanokwa who uses Oracle Java v1.8.x running on macOS Sierra. 

To generate official signed releases, you'll need the GPG folder, GPG passwords, a configured `secrets.xml` file.

1. Update the version in `build.gradle` and `pom.xml` and merge the changes to master. 
    * Use `x.x.x-SNAPSHOT` for snapshots releases and `x.x.x` for production releases.
2. In the repo folder, run `mvn -s secrets.xml clean deploy` to publish. 
    * If successful, both snapshots and production releases will appear in OSSRH [here](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/opendatakit/opendatakit-javarosa/). 
    * Production releases are automatically synced to Central [here](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22opendatakit-javarosa%22) a few hours later.

Don't forget to update the `build.gradle` files in any downstream tools (e.g., ODK Collect, ODK Briefcase) to the newest version!
